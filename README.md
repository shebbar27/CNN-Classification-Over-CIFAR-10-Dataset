# CNN-Classification-Over-CIFAR-10-Dataset

The objective of the project is to perform the classification task, using a convolutional neural network on the CIFAR-10 dataset using Google CoLab platform.
Also, experiment with the code by changing some of the hyper-parameters and train the network with the training set and then test it on the testing set after experimenting with different hyper-parameters. Analyse the impact of modified parameters on the accuracy of classification on the testing set.
